basic concept is that we take in an image and we conver that image to dots, we stipple the image with dots in black white and grey color scale

steps: 
1. set up the ability to take in user image 
2. process said image, convert to pixels, loop over each one, get average colours so u can balance the colours - pillow does this well, we load in the image and then loop over each pixel
3. find intensity of each pixel and replace it with a dot of equal intensity colour - average of rgb value 
4. output final product with matplotlib and then ask if the user wants to save it and then we can convert it to png and export it - use .save() from pillow to do this
5. final set up a website to do this and have this as the backend. 

future goals:
1. ability to adjust parameters like: contrast, number of dots, change symbol from dot to triangles or wahtever they decide
2. turn this into an accesability program, it can be used to help visually impared etc.
3. preview mode
4. ability to play around with the image pixels, like you can hover over the image's pixel dots and push them around
